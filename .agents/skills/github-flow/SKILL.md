# Fgentic GitHub Flow

Repo: `fmind-ai/fgentic` (public, Apache-2.0). All work is issue-driven; automate with `gh`.

## Backlog model

1. The roadmap is **GitHub milestones M0–M12** (sequenced sovereignty-first; history + mapping in [docs/roadmap.md](../../../docs/roadmap.md)). Each milestone has exactly one `kind/epic` tracker issue with the sweep order and definition of done — **start there, work top-to-bottom**.
1. List milestones: `gh api repos/fmind-ai/fgentic/milestones --jq '.[] | "\(.number) \(.title) — \(.open_issues) open"'`. Find an epic: `gh issue list --label kind/epic --milestone "<title>"`.
1. Labels: `agent-ready` = groomed, pick up as-is · `needs-human` = blocked on a maintainer decision/account/approval/spend — do the preparable parts, then hand off explicitly · `area/*` (bridge, infra, identity, matrix, models, federation, observability, security, ci, docs, community) · `kind/*` (feature, fix, test, chore, docs, research, epic).
1. Issue bodies cite `SPEC §N` — resolve via the mapping table in [.agents/AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md).
1. Standing rules: never start M8 (federation) items before its epic says the lab topology exists; never merge anything that assumes a single homeserver forever; settled designs (D1–D16, ADRs) are revisited by proposing a new ADR, not a drive-by PR.

## Picking up an issue

1. Read the issue's **Tasks + Acceptance criteria and follow them literally** — don't substitute your own scope.
1. Branch `<type>/<slug>` off `main`; one concern per branch.
1. Before claiming done: `mise run check` + `mise run test` **warning-free** (hooks and CI run the exact same tasks). Never weaken an assertion, skip a test, or suppress a lint to get green.
1. Commit: Conventional Commits **with DCO sign-off** (`git commit -s`). No AI-attribution trailers.

## Authoring issues & epics (keep the backlog consistent)

1. Issue body format: `## Context` (why, citing `D<n>`/`SPEC §N`) · `## Tasks` (checkboxes, each independently verifiable) · `## Acceptance criteria` (observable outcomes, not implementation). Label with exactly one `kind/*`, the `area/*`s it touches, and `agent-ready` **only if** the tasks + criteria are executable without a maintainer decision (else `needs-human`, naming the blocking part). Always assign a milestone.
1. Epic body format (one per milestone, `kind/epic`): a paragraph with the theme, sweep-order rationale, and definition of done, then `## Issues (sweep top-to-bottom)` as a checklist of `#N` references — closing keywords in PRs tick it automatically.
1. Before opening a design-changing issue, check D1–D16 and the ADRs: settled designs need a proposed ADR (see the docs-spec skill), not an issue asking to relitigate.

## Pull requests

1. Fill the PR template (What / Why / How / Test plan); link the issue with closing keywords (`Fixes #N` — this ticks the epic checklist). PRs are squash-merged.
1. `gh pr create --fill --body-file <(...)` then watch CI: `gh pr checks --watch`.

## CI / CD behavior

1. `ci.yml` (push to main + PRs): `mise run format` → `check` → `test` → **clean-tree assert** (`git status --porcelain` empty) — unformatted files or generated drift fail CI even if checks pass.
1. `cd.yml` (push to main touching `apps/matrix-a2a-bridge/**`): multi-arch image build → push to GHCR → trivy vuln scan (HIGH/CRITICAL fails) → cosign keyless sign → pins the immutable digest into `apps/matrix-a2a-bridge/deploy/helmrelease.yaml` and commits it back with `[skip ci]`. **CI is the only writer of that digest line** — never edit it by hand; Flux deploys whatever digest is in git.
1. After a bridge merge, `main` moves again (the digest commit) — `git pull --rebase` before pushing.

## Releases & security

1. Releases are semver `v*` tags with a git-cliff changelog + GitHub Release; bridge image and chart release together. Maintainers cut them (see the `release` skill / [GOVERNANCE.md](../../../GOVERNANCE.md)).
1. **Never file vulnerabilities as public issues** — private reporting per [SECURITY.md](../../../SECURITY.md).
